# Example Evaluator Backend
An example Flask backend which evaluates an input on a model.
This project was written as an example of how a machine learning model can be embedded into an application.

To run the server, run app.py, which creates the Flask instance (or use "flask run" in the home directory)
Variables for configuration are in config.py
The endpoints of the application are defined in endpoints.py
